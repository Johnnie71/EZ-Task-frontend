# EZ-Task 📝

![GIF DEMO](gif/EZ-GIF.gif)

## Origin ✨
For our mod3 project my partner and I, Seyi. We decided to try and make an application where user actions would be updated to the DOM without a refresh of the page. While using vanilla JavaScript. So we created and designed a clean and simple application intended to serve as an extension of a desktop. With the functionality of organization in a posted notes format📝. Leaving behind no wasted paper and a clutter of a mess around your desk. Sounds planet friendly dont it? 🌎😎

## Features 💡

A user can create a note, edit, and delete notes. As well show or hide notes for visible security. Notes are organized alphabetically by subject.

## Technologies Used 🛠

* Active Record
* Ruby on Rails
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Design 🎨

We used vanilla CSS for icons, buttons, styling and forms
